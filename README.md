Hobby Project from 2015 - Generic Multiplayer Zombie Defense Game

This is a generic zombie defense game that I built in my spare time during the 2015 school year. It is networked and allows for upto four players to join a room together.

To play, download and extract the GZDGBuild.zip, and run GZDGBuild.

In addition to the game I have uploaded a select set of scripts for viewing online.
